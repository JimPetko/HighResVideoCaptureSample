.Net Framework 4.8 is required but older versions may function.
Open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2015 or newer.

The application is built with .NET Framework 4.8 but it is compatible with older frameworks.
Press F5 to build the application.

if you get a 'BadImage' exception, modify the build target from Any CPU to x86.

if you get any 'DLL missing' exceptions, make sure to put a copy of 'TwCameraLib.dll' & 'TwCameraLibNET.dll' in the same directory as the executable.
Let me know if you have any difficulty.
