# Summary

Windows Form application that will stream High resolution video sources and capture with an integrated game controller listener. 

# Background

The currently released and upcoming IOC products and High Resolution Color Imaging devices in the dental industry are accelerating faster than Dental Imaging Acquisition Software can keep up.

# Goals

Digital Doc has provided this code for the explicit purpose of generating successful integrations for all of its products. 

### Non-Goals

This application is not designed to serve as a replacement for an integrated imaging module in any Dental Imaging Acquisition platform. It should only serve as a code reference.

# Proposed Solution

A Dental Imaging Acquisition Software Provider may use this code as reference in implementation of High Resolution Video Devices. The Tested outputs are listed below 

- 4200 x 3120 20FPS MJPEG
- 4096 x 2160 30FPS MJPEG
- 3840 x 2160 30FPS MJPEG
- 2880 x 2160 30FPS MJPEG
- 1920 x 1080 60FPS UYVY & MJPEG
- 1440 x 1080 45FPS UYVY & MJPEG
- 1280 x 720 60FPS UYVY & MJPEG
- 640 x 480 120FPS UYVY & MJPEG
